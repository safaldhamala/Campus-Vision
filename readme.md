## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an image classification model to identify and classify 10 buildings on the Mississippi State University campus. The goal is to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the ResNet-18 architecture, which is a popular choice for image recognition tasks due to its balanced performance in both accuracy and training efficiency.

### Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The dataset was organized into folders based on building names, with each folder representing a class.
   - Data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, horizontal flipping, and normalization were applied to enhance generalization and prevent overfitting.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - We used the pre-trained **ResNet-18** model, replacing its final layer to match the number of classes in our dataset.
   - This model was fine-tuned on our dataset for optimal results.

3. **Training Process**:
   - The model was trained using Cross-Entropy Loss and optimized with SDG optimizer.
   - The model was evaluated across 15 epochs, with metrics calculated for training and validation phases.
   - We trained some models with limited amount of data to tune the hyperparameters.
   - **The final model took nearly 8 hours to train on a CPU with 16 cores and 128 GB of RAM.**

### Model Performance
After training, the model achieved:
- **Validation Accuracy**: 98.49%
- **Metrics**:
  - **Precision**: 0.9850
  - **Recall**: 0.9849
  - **F1 Score**: 0.9849
  - **Log Loss**: 0.0545
